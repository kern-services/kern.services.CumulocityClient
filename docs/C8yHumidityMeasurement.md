# kern.services.CumulocityClient.Model.C8yHumidityMeasurement
There are three main measurements of humidity; absolute, relative and specific.  Absolute humidity is the water content of air. Relative humidity, expressed as a percentage, measures the current absolute humidity relative to the maximum for that temperature. Specific humidity is a ratio of the water vapour content of the mixture to the total air content on a mass basis.
