# kern.services.CumulocityClient.Model.C8yLightMeasurement
Light is measured with two main alternative sets of units.  Radiometry consists of measurements of light power at all wavelengths, while photometry measures light with wavelength weighted with respect to a standardized model of human brightness perception. Photometry is useful, for example, to quantify illumination (lighting) intended for human use.
